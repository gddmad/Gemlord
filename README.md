# Gemlord
QB64 Game. Locate all the gems in the game and win.

Still in progress.
NOT NEAR COMPLETION

What needs to be done:
<ul><li>
Create more levels to hide more gems.
</li><li>
Create links to those levels in the main gemlord.bas file
</li><li>
Have some fun with it and create levels as a meditation because it can be extremely tedious
</li></ul>
